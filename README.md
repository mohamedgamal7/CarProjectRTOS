## Project Overview

The **Autonomous Light Tracker Car** is an exciting and educational embedded system project that transforms a car into an intelligent and autonomous light-tracking vehicle. By integrating various sensors, actuators, and a microcontroller, this project offers an engaging and interactive experience for hobbyists, students, and robotics enthusiasts.

## Key Features

- **Light Tracking Capabilities:** The core feature of this project is its ability to autonomously track and follow a light source using a Light-Dependent Resistor (LDR). This showcases the fundamentals of autonomous navigation.

- **Obstacle Avoidance:** The project incorporates an ultrasonic sensor that allows the car to detect and avoid obstacles in its path, ensuring safe operation.

- **Temperature Monitoring:** A real-time temperature sensor is included, providing environmental data and displaying it on an integrated LCD screen.

- **User-Friendly LCD Display:** An LCD display provides visual feedback, showcasing temperature readings, light tracking status, and obstacle avoidance.

- **Customizable and Expandable:** The project is open-source, making it customizable and expandable. You can enhance its functionality and add additional features.

- **Educational Value:** This project serves as an educational platform for learning about embedded systems, sensor integration, real-time operating systems, and robotics.
